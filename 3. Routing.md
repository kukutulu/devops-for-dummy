## Routing

Run a proxy service to recognizing and routing ports

**NOTE**: Check ubuntu server structure to know where to store files and folders.

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file [here](./ubuntu%20server%20structure/root/proxy/docker-compose.yml)

Run docker-compose file, check if proxy service is running

Create a certs folder, contain your domain certification and key (get from your domain management platform)

Create a .nginx file: [example](./ubuntu%20server%20structure/root/proxy/conf.d/config_example.nginx)

Add some record on DNS section in Cloudflare

Now try pull your projects, go to `your apps or service` folder, run them like tutorial in step 2 ([Build and Deploy](2.%20Build%20and%20Deploy.md))

Next step: learn [jenkins](./Jenkins/readme.md)
