## Build and Deploy using DOCKER

### What is Docker?:

[Docker is here](./DOCKER/readme.md)

### Docker compose:

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience.

Compose simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.

Compose works in all environments; production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. It also has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

- Start, stop, and rebuild services
- View the status of running services
- Stream the log output of running services
- Run a one-off command on a service

### Prepare:

this tutorial use docker and docker compose, so first, install docker and docker compose on your remote server:

```
# Install docker and docker compose

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose

# Start docker

sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker // start automatically at boot
```

open your project, create these files:

dockerfile:

```
# Build stage
FROM node:18 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN yarn
COPY . .
RUN yarn build

# Production stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
```

nginx.conf:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain www.your_domain;

    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        index index.html
    }
}
```

docker-compose.yml:

```
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

deploy.sh:

```
#!/bin/bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Build and start containers
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d

# Clean up unused images
docker image prune -f
```

Your project structure now should look like this:

```
your-project/
├── src/                  # Your web app source code
├── package.json
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml    # Here
├── deploy.sh            # Here
├── nginx.conf
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── deploy.yml
```

Make deploy.sh executable: `chmod +x deploy.sh`

Now push all changes to your github repo

pull your repo to /var/www on server, run:

> ./deploy.sh

Now try running `docker images` and `docker ps` to make sure docker is running correctly. You can also try to check your web on browser to see changes.

**NOTE**:
Since we're moving to Docker, you don't need the nginx configuration file in /etc/nginx/conf.d/ on the host server anymore since nginx is now running inside the the Docker container. Here's what you should do:

1. Disable and remove old nginx configuration:

```
# Remove old config file
sudo rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/my-config.conf

# Stop and disable nginx on host
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl disable nginx

# Confirm nginx is stop
systemctl status nginx
```

2. Remove unused nginx package

Your nginx configuration is now handled by the nginx.conf file in your project, which gets copied into the Docker container. Remember from the Dockerfile:

```
# This line copies your nginx.conf into the container
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

**NOTE**: If any problem occur, you can run `docker logs container_name --tail 50
` to see the problem
